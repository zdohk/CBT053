                                                             REV 07/31/87
-
  DLXJOBST IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO AID JOB CONTROL BY DYNAMICALLY STARTING
  A SPECIFIED JOB IF THE CURRENT JOB EXECUTES SUCCESSFULLY.  DLXJOBST WOULD
  NORMALLY BE EXECUTED AS THE LAST STEP IN THE JOB STREAM.  THE EIGHT-DIGIT
  NAME OF THE JOB TO BE STARTED IS SPECIFIED EITHER AS PARM DATA, OR IN SYSIN.
  A 'COND' IS CODED ON THE EXEC STATEMENT SO THAT DLXJOBST WILL NOT EXECUTE IF
  THE PREVIOUS JOB STEPS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL.
-                        DLXJOBST RULES:
0      DLXJOBST CANNOT BE EXECUTED AS THE FIRST STEP IN THE JOBSTREAM.
0      THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS OF THE JOB TO BE STARTED MUST MATCH THE FIRST
       THREE CHARACTERS OF THE CURRENT JOB NAME.
0      THE JOB TO BE STARTED MUST BE SEVEN OR EIGHT CHARACTERS IN LENGTH.
0      THE JOB TO BE STARTED MUST NOT MATCH THE CURRENT JOB NAME.
0      NOTE:  THE USER MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE JOB TO BE STARTED DOES NOT
       CONTAIN A DLXJOBST STEP THAT STARTS THE ORIGINAL JOB STREAM AGAIN!
